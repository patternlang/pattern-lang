### Paradigms of Pattern Lang

_Object Oriented and Functional are not mutually exclusive paradigms for programming._

Pattern is designed to allow programmers to utilize modern Functional
paradigms in an Object Oriented environment that encourages best practices of
both application designs and the code written to accomplish the goals of the
application itself.

Pattern includes foundational objects to inherit from that allow you to create full
applications that apply industry standard patterns and practices such as Model View
Controller, Adapter, Facade and Strategy Patterns.  Within the code you will use
immutable Models and Records that include automatic versioning and state tracking.
[Dependency Injection](#DI) provides modern amenities such as loose coupling that
allows for strong cohesion between data and logic.
