
### End Keyword

The `End` keyword denotes the end of a block of code, such as for structures, methods and scope changes.

The `End` keyword should always be followed by the identifier of the block of code, method or structure
it applies to.

```pattern

Application MyApplication

// End is always followed by the identifier
// of the structure being ended.
End MyApplication
```
